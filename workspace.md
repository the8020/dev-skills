# Development starts with 8020-dev

For all development here, use `8020-dev` from your agent's merged skill catalog
(including a custom override, if present), then the relevant domain skills. The
[shipped router](/workspace/skills/builtin/8020-dev/SKILL.md) explains
independent package repositories, private edits, activation, and live
verification. Read the target package's AGENTS.md and its applicable child
contracts before editing; complete their DOX pass and checks.

This workspace contains packages, not a master Git repository. Make changes in
`/workspace/packages/<namespace>/<package>`. The activated `the8020/dev-skills`
package supplies this guide and the read-only `/workspace/skills/builtin` tree.
Edit shipped skills in `/workspace/packages/the8020/dev-skills` and activate
that package normally. The same guide is exposed as AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md.

Add personal skills at `/workspace/skills/custom/<name>/SKILL.md` with matching
`name` and `description` frontmatter. That writable directory persists in your
user sandbox data across restart, source reset, and activation; factory reset
removes it. Custom names override built-ins. After adding, removing, or renaming
a skill, run `/workspace/scripts/setup-agent-skills.sh` and reload the agent if
needed. Startup and CLI installation also refresh discovery. Both Codex and
Claude use home-directory links, keeping these skills visible inside package Git
roots. Existing unmanaged home skills are preserved and collisions are reported.
Custom skills stay private; package activation does not publish them.

Framework source:
[agent0ai/dox/AGENTS.md](https://github.com/agent0ai/dox/blob/765ae4ac02cc884eefcd41a3d0f71941721adb89/AGENTS.md).

# DOX framework

- DOX is highly performant AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here
- Agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable
  docs must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every
  parent AGENTS.md above it

## Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path,
   read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide
   rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child
   doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session
before editing.

## Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or
  quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child
index changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove
stale or contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior
or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

## Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences,
  durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX
  Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by
  the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

## Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own
  purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user
  instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it
  empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework
  exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:

- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

## Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries
- Put broad rules in parent docs and concrete details in child docs
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope needs a local
  version
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for
  risks that no longer exist

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

## User Preferences

- Always use the 8020-dev router for development and the applicable domain
  skills.
- Keep built-in skills and workspace instructions read-only. Developer skills
  are writable and private in `/workspace/skills/custom`.

## Child DOX Index

- [dev-skills/AGENTS.md](/workspace/skills/builtin/AGENTS.md): shipped
  development skills and their maintenance/discovery contract.
- Each installed `packages/<namespace>/<package>/AGENTS.md` owns that
  independent repository and its indexed descendants. Inspect the selected
  package's actual tree; installed and custom packages vary by system.
